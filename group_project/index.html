            <h3> What is Homelessness?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;"> Homelessness is one of Seattle's most pressing issues. In the Seattle King County area, there are an estimated 11, 751 people without proper housing, making Seattle one of the worst cities in the country for homelessness, next to Los Angeles
                and San Francisco. Many people who are experiencing homelessness suffer from mental health issues and drug/substance abuse. Mental illness and addiction afflict the homeless population substantially more than people with sufficient proper
                housing as an estimated 20-25% of the homeless population suffers from serious mental health issues compared to 4-6% of the general U.S. population. Additionally, homeless people are significantly more likely to use drugs regularly and
                have a chronic substance abuse issue. Homelessness usually amplifies mental health issues and added stress can result in worsened mental health and increased substance abuse. </p>

            <h3> Homelessness in Seattle</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Local government in Seattle has been taking many steps to address the homeless epidemic. The city is said to be focusing on " a person centered service model, investing in programs that can provide people housing, and addressing racial disparities".
                After Covid-19 worsened the situation with higher unemployment and poverty, the city provided more hygiene services such as restrooms. More recently, the city has been clearing out homeless camps around downtown Seattle as a part of the
                city's new tactic to address homelessness. This new tactic is in an effort to meet a bold new goal announced by King County in February 2022: get nearly everyone who is homeless in downtown Seattle into housing within a year. Major companies
                in the Seattle area such as Amazon, Microsoft, T-Mobile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have helped in funding $10 million for this new project. In recent news, many permanent housing areas have been implemented around the State
                including more suburban areas such as Bellevue and Kirkland. Permanent supportive housing through the Housing First Initiative aims to offer permanent housing to indiivuals with few barriers of entry so that people are more likely to participate.
                Permanent Supportive housing also aims to offer mental health services such as 1:1 counseling. However, some argue that throwing money into creating new housing units is not going to help. A report found that more than half of homeless
                people offered shelter by the city of Seattle refuse the offer. Because of this, many are worried about encampment sweeps considering majority of homeless people are living in tents and camps.
