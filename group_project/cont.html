<!--I challenged myself in this project through the use of design and new elements. In the past, I never really thought about design 
    and layout of web pages much, but after learning about CSS grid, I started to focus on how I should layout my elements and the page.
I also used new CSS attributes (commented) as well as new HTML tags to bring an extra challenge like adding in a map on the resources page.-->
<!--It was also a challenge to collect some of the content as I had to go around asking people to talk about their opinions for the quotes
section, which was tricky as it is a bit of a sensitive subject. Furthermore, the element of making sure the design and layout matches 
my group members was also a bit of a new challenge, but I think we were able to pull it off and work together well.-->

            <p>The implementation of La Quinta has been proven to be a very controversial topic.</p>
            <p>The following video provides a little more insight into the pro side of the argument, of which the City of Kirkland follows.</p>

            <h2>Arguments Against the Implementation of La Quinta:</h2>
            <p>The arguments against La Quinta mainly involve the safety of the surrounding area - including schools and office buildings. This is because people are still allowed to drink and use drugs while in the center, which parents don't want around
                their kids especially.

            <p>The arguments for La Quinta revolve around the safety of the greater good as providing a means of shelter for those who really need it would help their safety and quality of life. The location of La Quinta is perfect as well as it is very
                accessible due to its proximity to the park and ride.</p>

                <li>"Safety is important, but generalizing an entire group of people is not right in my opinion. Especially because those who are coming to the shelter are most likely people who are trying to get help and get better. <br> - anonymous</li>

                <li>"Lack of funds is correlated with violence, so although I do agree we should implement housing help, it should not be in an area with kids around. Kids should not be exposed to seeing such hardship from such a young age because that could
                    lead a pessimistic view of life. <br> - anonymous</li>
