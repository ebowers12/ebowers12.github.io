                Some info about how this program works:
                <br> When someone enters the program, they are assigned a specialist and other people who are striving to place them into permanent housing.
                <br> The basic idea of this approach is that people who are currently experiencing homelessness need basic needs such as food and a place to sleep
                <br> before they can begin to think about things like getting a job.
