    <h1> My Favorite Thing About School</h1>

    <h2>By Ella Bowers</h2>

    <p>My favorite thing about school are the <b>sports</b> I get to participate in with my friends. Sports are a great way to get away from your academics and the classroom or anything else that may be giving you stress and get active. I enjoy any oppurtunity
        to be active and being able to do it with my friends is my favorite part. I've done 3 sports this year, some with my school and some with another school and all of them have brought me closer to the people around me. Most importantly, sports have
        brought me closer to people who enjoy being active just as much as I do. </p>
