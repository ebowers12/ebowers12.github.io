    <p> Gymnastics is a very challenging sport to master. It consists of 4 events: Vault, Bars, Beam, and Floor. So really gymnastics is more like 4 sports in 1, making it all the harder to master.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr-NVhPJRJg"> Here's a video to understand the different events. </a>
    </p>

    <p> For gymnastics, you need both strength and flexibility. Elite gymnasts have to train for years, spending most of their hours inside a gym and getting their education through homeschool. Because gymnastics uses almost every muscle in the body, it requires
        years to master.

    </p>

    <p> However, before you get to that point, you have to focus on the basics. The most basic skills of gymnastics would be a cartwheel, a handstand, and a round off (although there's many others you could argue for). With those three skills mastered, you
        have the foundations for much harder skills such as handstand pirouettes on the bars or round off back-handspring backtuck.
