    <p> On this page, you will find a collection of images from my time in gymnastics. Many of the images are from my early days in gymnastics to my final State competition this past February. </p>

        <img src="images/samm 1.jpeg" alt="My highschool gymnastics team">

        <p> This is a picture of my final highschool gymnastics team. I was the only senior on the varsity lineup but because of covid, it had only been my 2nd time at a State wide competition for what should have been my 4th. Despite the young age of the
            team, we handled the competition and it was in our home gym!

        <img src="images/twisting.jpg" alt="Me mid-flip">

        <p> This is me at my last competition during the middle of my favorite event, floor, and during my favorite skill in all of gymnastics, a back twisting move.</p>

        <img src="images/splits.jpg" alt="Me in a split jump">

        <p> This is another image from my final floor routine featuring crazy facial expressions. </p>

        <img src="images/young 2.jpeg" alt="Me attempting my first cartwheel">

        <p> This is an image of me attempting my first cartwheel with more crazy facial expressions. </p>

        <img src="images/young.jpeg" alt="Me as a young gymnast">

        <p> This is an image of me in my early days of gymnastics when I was about 4 living in Connecticut. I am now a coach for kids that are about the same age as I was in this picture. </p>
